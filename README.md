## About
ByteSearch is a small flask project that includes both frontend and backend. ByteSearch uses DuckDuckGo's search api to build a simple search engine. ByteSearch also includes AI answers to search prompts, but it is disabled by default to help protect the privacy of users.<br>
To see ByteSearch in action go to [ByteSearch Website](https://bytesearch.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Open Source
